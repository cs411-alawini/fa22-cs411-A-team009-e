## Project Summary
NPSAdvisor is a web application that will make it easier for people to plan out their visit to different national parks. It will serve as a resource for accessing useful up-to-date information about all parks managed by the National Park Service using data provided by the NPS API. Users will be able to find out more about every parkâ€™s location, upcoming events, and popular activities all in one convenient place. The website will also provide detailed information about parking location and availability at each park location to address the common issue of not being able to find parking spots. By building NPSAdvisor, we hope to encourage more tourism.

The data is from various calls made to the [National Park Services API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/), a service that provides comprehensive National Park Service data about parks with this designation. It consists of data related to information about the parks themselves, things to do, parking lots, events, and various amenities. Each of the API calls will ultimately represent one table in the SQL database being used for the backend of NPSAdvisor. More specifically make calls to /parks, /thingstodo, /parkinglots, /events, and /amenities/parksplaces.
